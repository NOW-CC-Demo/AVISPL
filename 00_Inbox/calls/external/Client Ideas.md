Possible AI Agent considerations:

Dispatch Coordinator Agent
Evaluate case parameters (skill, geography, SLA)
Evaluate Regional Field Service tech parameters (skill, geography, availability)
Auto-assign WOT to most suitable agent
Communicate assignment to stakeholders
 
Remote Troubleshooting Agent
Evaluate case Problem Description
Use accessible tools to determine most likely cause
                                                              i.      SNOW Case history/site/room history
                                                             ii.      Manufacturer website/white papers
                                                           iii.      Access to SDCS for as-built documentation?
Determine if remote fix is possible
If remote fix not possible, suggest possible resolution steps for Field Service
Create WOT that includes this information

Other process opportunities:

Customer automated communications
Dispatch notifications for planned dispatches, updates to planned dispatches
Part/Order shipping notifications related to cases/dispatches
Advanced Work Assignment/Case Queue Management
Identifying best case owners based on case content/history, account team relationships, etc
Similar to AWA but utilizing AI functionality to streamline configuration and in life maintenance/operations
This may include components of case summarization, resolution summarization, and wot summarization, along with generation of next steps for resolution
Knowledge Management
Knowledge creation/upkeep
Case/chat deflection
PMV Process
PMV record creation (currently WO, future state case) based on contract configuration, along with initial scheduling and/or updated scheduling contingent on PMVs created to date during the lifecycle of a contract
Recommendations on sequencing and assignment based on locations/outstanding activities
Alert/Event Management
Proactively recommend PRBs or Incidents based on current alerts
Proactive recommendations on root cause and resolutions to resolve
What'sApp and Chat Integrations
If there is an opportunity, might benefit from external connector integration to allow search/return of information based on data that sits outside ServiceNow (e.g. BKR, D365, SDCS)
Locating job information, drawings, finance
